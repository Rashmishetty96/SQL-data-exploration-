🌐 COVID-19 Data Exploration

🔍 Project Overview:
Explore COVID-19 data using SQL queries to uncover insights about infections, deaths, and vaccinations. Utilized advanced SQL techniques including joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), temp tables, window functions, and aggregate functions to analyze data from PortfolioProject's COVIDDeaths and CovidVaccinations datasets.

🛠️ Skills Utilized:
Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

📊 Project Highlights:

Analyzed COVID-19 data to compare total cases vs total deaths, infection rates vs population, and countries with the highest death counts per population.
Investigated global COVID-19 trends, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.
Explored the relationship between total population and vaccinations, calculating the percentage of the population that received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.
📈 Data Queries:
The project includes various SQL queries to filter and analyze COVID-19 data, such as retrieving total cases and deaths by location, calculating death percentages, and exploring vaccination rates.

📝 Data Manipulation:
Implemented advanced SQL techniques to perform calculations, create temporary tables, and generate views for further analysis.
